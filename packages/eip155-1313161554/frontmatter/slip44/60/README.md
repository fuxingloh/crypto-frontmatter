# Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a
platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.

Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured
funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014. The project team managed to raise $18.3
million in Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s price in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was $0.311, with over 60 million Ether sold.
Taking Ethereum’s price now, this puts the return on investment (ROI) at an annualized rate of over 270%, essentially
almost quadrupling your investment every year since the summer of 2014.

The Ethereum Foundation officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015, under the prototype codenamed “Frontier.”
Since then, there has been several network updates — “Constantinople” on Feb. 28, 2019, “Istanbul” on Dec. 8, 2019,
“Muir Glacier” on Jan. 2, 2020, “Berlin” on April 14, 2021, and most recently on Aug. 5, 2021, the “London” hard fork.

Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all
over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.
