# Celo

Celo is a carbon-negative, permissionless, blockchain with a rich ecosystem of global partners building innovative Web3
dapps to support a more inclusive financial system. Accessible to anyone with a mobile phone, the Celo ecosystem
consists of a decentralized, proof-of-stake blockchain technology stack (the Celo platform), CELO governance asset, and
several Mento stable assets (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL) that allow for real-world users to use digital assets. The open source
Celo mainnet launched on Earth Day 2020. The Celo community passed an indicative on-chain governance
proposal (temperature check) to have Celo migrate to an Ethereum layer-2. Google Cloud, Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica,
and many others run validators on the Celo Platform. Today, the Platform supports 1,000+ projects in over 150 countries
