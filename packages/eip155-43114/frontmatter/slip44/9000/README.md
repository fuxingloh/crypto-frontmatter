# Avalanche

Avalanche is a layer one blockchain that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain
networks. It is one of Ethereum’s rivals, aiming to unseat Ethereum as the most popular blockchain for smart contracts.
It aims to do so by having a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising
scalability.

This is made possible by Avalanche’s unique architecture. The Avalanche network consists of three individual
blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the
approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use
different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases.
