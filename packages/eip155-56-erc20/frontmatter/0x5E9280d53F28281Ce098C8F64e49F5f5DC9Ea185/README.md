# SnowgeCoin

SnowgeCoin is a community owned, floofy doggo-themed Safemoon fork that functions as a deflationary auto-staking currency, with a randomized transaction fee of: 2%, 4%, 6% or 8%. Half of each fee is reflected back to holders, and the other half is added to the BNB/Snowge Liquidity Pool.
