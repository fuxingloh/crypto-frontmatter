# Stargazer Protocol

Stargazer is comprised of many modules which will be based on tiers. Rugcheck - Ability to rug check a coin and get a rug score. Whale Watch - Watch a wallets movements in real time. Get alerts when buy/sells happen. Adjust the alerts to show only buys, or only sells, or both. Harpoon - With a simple list of coins and a very recent list of holders of one of those coins you can identify a person of interest's wallet address with the harpoon technology.
