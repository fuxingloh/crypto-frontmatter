# Shield Token

The SHIELD Token protocol is designed for Holders by putting aside 8% of each transaction and adding them to a BNB pool. Each holder can withdraw from the pool once a day according to his share of shield tokens\*. Furthermore, 6% of each transaction goes into LP and 2% of each SHIELD transaction gets reflected to all holders.
