# DeFiChain

DeFiChain (DFI) is a blockchain platform built with the mission of maximizing the full potential of DeFi within the
Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem. The software platform is supported by a distributed network of computers and is designed to
facilitate fast and transparent transactions. The development team positions DeFiChain as an innovative blockchain
project and offers solutions to problems like scalability, security and decentralization.

The project was launched in the fall of 2019 with the aim of offering financial services that commercial banks typically
provide (borrowing, lending, investing, keeping funds). Yet there is a key difference between DeFiChain and a banking
network: DeFiChain is a decentralized platform. This provides a number of advantages: authorities and entities cannot
control the network and anyone has the right to participate in the launch of the network protocol. All actions support
the entire network and participants in the process receive DFI tokens.

The DeFiChain platform ensures fast, transparent and decentralized financial services. The project is built on Bitcoin
as a software fork and is tied to the Bitcoin blockchain using a Merkle root every few blocks. DeFiChain transactions
are non-Turing complete, which makes them fast and smooth, with low gas costs and a reduced risk of smart contract
errors.

DeFiChainâ€™s initial functions and products include: lending, token wrapping, pricing oracles, exchanges, asset
tokenization, distribution of dividends, and more.
