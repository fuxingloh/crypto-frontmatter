# Binance Smart Chain

Launched in July 2017, Binance is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange globally based on daily trading volume. Binance
aims to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to the forefront of financial activity globally. The idea behind Binance’s name
is to show this new paradigm in global finance — Binary Finance, or Binance.

Aside from being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has launched a whole ecosystem of functionalities
for its users. The Binance network includes the Binance Chain, Binance Smart Chain, Binance Academy, Trust Wallet and
Research projects, which all employ the powers of blockchain technology to bring new-age finance to the world. BNB is an
integral part of the successful functioning of many of the Binance sub-projects.
