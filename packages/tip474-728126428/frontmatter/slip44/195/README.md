# Tron

TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017.
Originally TRX tokens were ERC-20-based tokens deployed on Ethereum, but a year later they were moved to their own
network.

Initially, the project was created with the aim of providing full ownership rights to makers of digital content. The
main goal is to help content creators (who receive only a small part of the income) and encourage them with more rewards
for their work. How: invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube,
Facebook or Apple).

The TRON software supports smart contracts, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka
dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin (BTC), namely UTXO. Transactions take
place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations.

Therefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create
dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create dApps on the TRON network, offer content, and in return
receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts. The ability to create content and share it openly without
hesitation regarding transaction fees is an undeniable advantage of TRON.
