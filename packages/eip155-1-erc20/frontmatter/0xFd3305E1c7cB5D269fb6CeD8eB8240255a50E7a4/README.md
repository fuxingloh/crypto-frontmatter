# Cloudbit Token

Cloudbit – CDB and CDBC is a cryptocurrency Exchange Token. In order to unite a link with the CBDC “Central Bank Digital Currency”, there was a need for a global digital transaction instrument to also be able to strengthen P2P services and decentralization. CDB and CDBC created to cater the needs.
